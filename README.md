# Java Number Parser and Analyzer

## Overview

This Java program is designed to read and analyze numbers from a text file. 
It parses each line of the file, extracts integer values, and performs various operations to determine the maximum value and its indexes in the list.
In case of errors (e.g., missing file, faulty data), the program prints *** on the console.

## Usage

To run this program, ensure you have a file named tab.txt in your home directory with the desired content.
The program expects this file to contain integers, each possibly separated by spaces or new lines.
